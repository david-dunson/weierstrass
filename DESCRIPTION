Authors@R: "Xiangyu Wang <xw56@stat.duke.edu> [aut, cre]"
Description: The Weierstrass sampler is a "divide-conquer-combine" type
    parallel MCMC sampler. The implementation in this package is the particular
    rejection sampler which directly works on the subset posterior samples as a
    post-processing sampler. The method make use of rejection sampling or
    importance sampling to combine the subset posterior samples for
    approximating the posterior obtained on the full data set.
