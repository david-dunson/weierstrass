===========

Combining posterior samples from multiple subsets.

Description: The Weierstrass sampler is a "divide-conquer-combine" type parallel MCMC sampler. The implementation in this package is the particular post-processing sampler. The method make use of rejection sampling or importance sampling to combine the subset posterior samples for approximating the posterior obtained on the full data set.
